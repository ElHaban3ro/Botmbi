# BOTMBI
Invite Botmbi to your server and make requests directly to your ombi from it! Request movies and series (per season) using the discord UI, and giving permissions only to some roles to request content. An easy solution for you and the members of a server to request content without having to access directly to the ombi!!!!

PD: I recommend having a specific role to be able to request content (configuration in the next section).
